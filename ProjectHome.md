**[cueconv.sh](http://code.google.com/p/vvoodys/source/browse/#svn/trunk/cueconv)**

A easy bash script to convert and track the flac/ape single file to mp3/ogg files according to the cue file. And we will write the id3v2 into them. Thanks for Grissiom's help.

**[vbak.sh](http://code.google.com/p/vvoodys/source/browse/#svn/trunk/vbak)**

Vbak is a handy tool for backuping your config files in Linux. I hope it make me backup, update, checkout files and show backuped files status easily.
